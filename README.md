# FundamentalChemistry
Minecraft forge mod of fundamental chemistry (molecular/nuclear manipulation).

The mod doesn't seek realism, it's about taking inspiration from our modern times the same way we take inspiration from ancient era (like water/fire/wind/earth elements, etc).

## WIP

## Concept

* Inspired from the periodic table.
* Every atoms/molecules quantities are expressed as mole unit. The quantum is the mole.

### Items

#### Vibrant catalyst stone

Item (made of diamond, obsidian and stone) used in most of the other crafts.

### Blocks

#### Versatile generator

* A powerful generator to power the laser network and the machines.
* Not only combustion, this generator can be used in many ways, like draining power directly from the environment.

#### Laser relay

* Can be connected to other laser relays to transfer atoms and molecules.
* Laser relays can be connected to machines or placed on the world to increase the transfer distance.
* Laser relays can be connected to an unlimited number of relays in range.
* Connected machines drain things from the laser network when needed.

Technical notes:

* Things are taken by input requests (nothing move if nothing needs it).
* Fetching things in a laser network from a relay will not go further the chemical containers (machines, storages, etc). This means that if a storage is connected behind a machine, unless there is another way, only this machine will be able to fetch the storage.

#### Item breaker

Machine to break item into molecules.

#### Molecule breaker

Machine to break molecules into atoms.

#### Molecular storage

Store molecules.

#### Periodic storage

Store atoms of the periodic table.

#### Molecule assembler

Assemble atoms to form molecules.

#### Item assembler

Assemble molecules to form items.

#### Positive nuclear transmuter

"Punch" atoms to increase their proton/electron number (the amount is given by the item used).
This is an hard task.

#### Negative nuclear transmuter

"Snatch" atoms to decrease their proton/electron number (the amount is given by the item used).
This is an hard task.
